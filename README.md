The activity-regulated cytoskeletal (Arc) is a complex protein resulting from interactions among
genetic and other factors. The mechanism of Arc development remains unknown. This study
proposes that proteinâ€“protein interactions (PPIs) and pathway interactions network, particularly
those among proteins encoded by casual or susceptibility genes. The component of our constructed
PPI network comprised 61 nodes with 505 edges, and pathway network contains 120 nodes and 782
edges. By using parameters of large degree (k), high betweenness centrality (BC), and eccentricity
we find hub nodes for both networks and the most important protein contributed to the network.
